# CricketBowlerClassification
The motto of this project was to identify the picture of a bowler into one of the five category of bowlers, namely: OffSpinner, LegSpinner, Swing Bowler, Fast Bowler and Slow Arm Chinamen.
The model predicts the right label on most occasions, however, for better precision, it needs more training image inputs as I had just provided 100 for each class.
As an extension, I created a Tensorflow model that tries to identify the bowler from a video input (using the OpenCV library)
